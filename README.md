This application is built with React and demonstrates the use of the `useState` Hook to manage dynamic state. Users can create a personalized list of jobs or tasks, assign a priority level to each task—such as "must do", "want to do", or "take it or leave it"—and easily manage their list.

## Features

- **Add Jobs:** Enter a new job or task and assign it a priority level.
- **Prioritize Tasks:** Choose between "must do", "want to do", or "take it or leave it" for each job.
- **Edit Tasks:** Update the job description or change its priority at any time.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove jobs from the list as needed.
- **Visual Priority:** Each job displays a color or style that reflects its priority, making it easy to identify important tasks.

This project highlights key React concepts, including state management with `useState`, passing data as props, and rendering lists dynamically. It provides a practical example of building an interactive and user-friendly task management tool with React.
